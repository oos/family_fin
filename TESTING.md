## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Install test dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r test_requirements.txt
```

2. Set up test database:
```bash
python setup_test_db.py
```

### Running All Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run with coverage
python run_tests.py --coverage

# Run specific test types
python run_tests.py --type unit
python run_tests.py --type integration
python run_tests.py --type api

# Skip slow tests
python run_tests.py --fast
```

### Running Individual Test Files

```bash
# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_api_auth.py -v

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/test_api_auth.py::TestAuthAPI -v

# Run specific test method
pytest tests/test_api_auth.py::TestAuthAPI::test_login_success -v
```

### Running with Pytest Directly

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific markers
pytest -m "not slow"
pytest -m "integration"
```

## Test Configuration

### Pytest Configuration (`pytest.ini`)

- **Test Discovery**: Automatically finds tests in `tests/` directory
- **Coverage**: Requires 80% code coverage minimum
- **Markers**: Supports `slow`, `integration`, `api`, `frontend` markers
- **Output**: Verbose output with short tracebacks

### Test Database

- **Type**: SQLite in-memory database for tests
- **Isolation**: Each test gets a fresh database
- **Sample Data**: Automatically created via fixtures
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup after each test

## Coverage Reports

After running tests with coverage, view the HTML report:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# View report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Metrics

| Test Category | Max Time | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| API Tests | 5 seconds | Individual endpoint tests |
| Integration Tests | 10 seconds | End-to-end workflows |
| GL Matching | 10 seconds | Full dataset matching |
| Data Fetch | 5 seconds | Large dataset retrieval |

### Performance Monitoring

Tests include performance assertions to ensure:
- API responses are fast
- Database queries are efficient
- Matching algorithms scale well
- Memory usage is reasonable

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions (Recommended)

```yaml
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.11
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install -r test_requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: python run_tests.py --coverage
```

## Test Data Management

### Sample Data Creation

The test suite automatically creates comprehensive sample data:

- **Users**: Test users with authentication
- **Families**: Family groups
- **People**: Individual family members
- **Properties**: Real estate assets
- **Business Accounts**: Bank accounts
- **Income**: Income sources
- **Loans**: Mortgage and other loans
- **Pensions**: Retirement accounts
- **Tax Returns**: Sample tax data
- **GL Transactions**: General ledger entries
- **Bank Transactions**: Bank statement data

### Data Relationships

Tests verify that data relationships are maintained:
- People belong to families
- Income is associated with people
- Loans are linked to properties
- Transactions are connected to accounts

## Debugging Tests

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Ensure test database is properly configured
   - Check SQLite file permissions

2. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify JWT secret key is set
   - Check user creation in fixtures

3. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check Python path configuration

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Run with debug output
pytest -v -s

# Run single test with debug
pytest tests/test_api_auth.py::TestAuthAPI::test_login_success -v -s

# Run with pdb debugger
pytest --pdb

# Run with detailed output
pytest -vvv
```

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Create test file in `tests/` directory
2. Follow naming convention: `test_*.py`
3. Use appropriate fixtures from `conftest.py`
4. Add proper assertions and error handling
5. Update this documentation

### Updating Existing Tests

1. Maintain backward compatibility
2. Update assertions when requirements change
3. Keep test data realistic
4. Ensure tests are deterministic

### Test Review Checklist

- [ ] Tests cover happy path scenarios
- [ ] Tests cover error conditions
- [ ] Tests verify data integrity
- [ ] Tests include performance checks
- [ ] Tests are well-documented
- [ ] Tests are maintainable

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test suite ensures the Family Finance App is reliable, performant, and maintainable. The tests cover all major functionality including the critical GL transaction matching feature that achieves a 96.7% match rate.
